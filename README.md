# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


# Challenges

It turns out that when I was studying the modules, I had the right idea of how to do it and how it should work and I did it properly. But for some odd reason it did not work. An example of something that just didn't work was the current day display. The problem was that I made a mistake in the javascript lines and decided to delete the corrupted ones and replaced them with ones that worked.

I did get help from Naomi who shared me her code to see what I didn't do correctly and how to do the assignment! In addition my tutor also helped me out by explaining to me the process of how to use API's-especially the save function and getItem(). Thanks to my tutor, I did manage to understand how the process of APIs and other programs worked.

Some images of development!

<img src ="issue.png"
alt = "Big issue"
style = "float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

This one was when I was trying to get the everything to work, but as it turns out what i needed to do was have them under spereate tables and columns tags.

<img src ="failed attempt.png"
alt = "closer!"
style = "float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

This one is when I tried to fix the Jquery after asking in Slack on how do I fix my corrupted Jquery libaries before deciding to axe the idea entirely after spending several days trying to get Moment to work. This one I fixed by as stated before, deleting the bad files on the HTML doc.
